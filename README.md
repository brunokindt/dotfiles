# dotfiles

## Description

Configuration files for bash, zsh, vim and [i3](http://i3wm.org/). The configuration files are added to the user home directory using symlinks created by the bootstrap.sh script. Additional bash scripts and vim plugins are added using git submodules. The bootstrap script is only tested on my personal laptop (Fedora 19 & 20) - so use with care!
